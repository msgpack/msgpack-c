MessagePack for C/C++
=====================
Binary-based efficient object serialization library.


## Installation

Download latest package from [releases of MessagePack](http://sourceforge.net/projects/msgpack/files/) and extract it.

On UNIX-like platform, run ./configure && make && sudo make install:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

On Windows, open msgpack_vc8.vcproj or msgpack_vc2008 file and build it using batch build. DLLs are built on lib folder,
and the headers are built on include folder.

To use the library in your program, include msgpack.hpp header and link "msgpack" library.


## Example

    #include <msgpack.hpp>
    #include <vector>
    
    int main(void) {
        // This is target object.
        std::vector<std::string> target;
        target.push_back("Hello,");
        target.push_back("World!");
    
        // Serialize it.
        msgpack::sbuffer sbuf;  // simple buffer
        msgpack::pack(&sbuf, target);
    
        // Deserialize the serialized data.
        msgpack::unpacked msg;    // includes memory pool and deserialized object
        msgpack::unpack(&msg, sbuf.data(), sbuf.size());
        msgpack::object obj = msg.get();
    
        // Print the deserialized object to stdout.
        std::cout << obj << std::endl;    // ["Hello," "World!"]
    
        // Convert the deserialized object to staticaly typed object.
        std::vector<std::string> result;
        obj.convert(&result);
    
        // If the type is mismatched, it throws msgpack::type_error.
        obj.as<int>();  // type is mismatched, msgpack::type_error is thrown
    }
