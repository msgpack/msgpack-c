`msgpack` for C/C++
===================

It's like JSON but smaller and faster.

Overview
--------

[MessagePack](http://msgpack.org/) is an efficient binary serialization
format, which lets you exchange data among multiple languages like JSON,
except that it's faster and smaller. Small integers are encoded into a
single byte and short strings require only one extra byte in
addition to the strings themselves.
