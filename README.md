`msgpack` for C/C++
===================

It's like JSON but smaller and faster.

Overview
--------

[MessagePack](http://msgpack.Org/) is a good binary serialization
layout, which helps you to alternate records amongst a couple of languages like JSON,
except that it's quicker and smaller. Small integers are encoded right into a
unmarried-byte and quick strings require handiest one more byte in
addition to the strings themselves.
